Practicing

Saturday off so I copied https://www.tomorrow.one/en-EU/?ref=lapaninja with my own CSS and HTML.

I´m just learning from errors and practicing. 

I think it´s too early to start using Bootstrap or any other framework... I really want to master the basics first. 

I´m getting used to Flexbox and looking forward to start learning and putting in practice the Grid system. I just need some more practice with flexbox and it´s responsive attributes and then I´ll send it to grid!
